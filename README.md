# Hello, I'm Jason 👋

## Engineering Manager | Full Stack Engineer | AWS Cloud Architect



🚀 About Me:

I'm an orchestrator of code and cloud, leading teams to build robust, scalable, and cloud-native web applications. With a penchant for infrastructure automation and a toolkit brimming with NodeJS, C#, and Terraform, I turn ideas into reality on the digital canvas of AWS.

🔧 Tools & Tech:

- **Primary Languages:** NodeJS, C#, Terraform
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform magic for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins for the old-school cool, Atlantis for Terraform teamwork, and GitHub Actions for that integrated zing.

👨‍💻 Current Focus:

- **Engineering Management:** Steering the ship with a compass of best practices.
- **Full Stack Development:** Crafting back-end services and front-end experiences.
- **Cloud Architecture:** Designing resilient architectures that scale seamlessly.

🛠️ Projects:

- **Infrastructure Automation:** Streamlining deployment pipelines and infrastructure updates with the precision of a well-oiled machine.
- **Web Applications:** Building responsive, user-centric applications that stand the test of scale.
